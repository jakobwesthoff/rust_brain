# ðŸ¦€ðŸ§  rust_brain

An implementation of a [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter in Rust.

**WARNING:** The interpreter is a work in progress and not yet complete.

## Building

The project utilizes the Cargo build system. To build the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

## Execution

To execute the interpreter, run it from the command line with the brainfuck source code to interpret as the first argument. For example:

```shell
target/release/rust_brain examples/hello_world.brainfuck
```

## Purpose

This interpreter was developed purely for the enjoyment of coding. There is no practical use case for the brainfuck language or this interpreter. However, if you wish to join in the fun and follow the development process, there are videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MrJakob) showcasing the different stages of its creation.
